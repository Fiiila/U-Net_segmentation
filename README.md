# U-net_segmentation

mainly made according to describrion in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf
something inspired in https://keras.io/examples/vision/oxford_pets_image_segmentation/
something more inspired in https://github.com/nikhilroxtomar/UNet-Segmentation-in-Keras-TensorFlow/blob/master/unet-segmentation.ipynb

but everything made to work with simple custom dataset
pictures need to be .jpg
masks need to be .png with mask values 1,2,3...important!!! check before
for more than one mask need to repair some functions in train.py and DatasetGenerator.py
